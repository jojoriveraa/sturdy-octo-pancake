Quick Guide to Weather Underground REST API
-------------------------------------------

BASE URI - all requests begin with this, then you add path segments to specify what you want.
http://api.wunderground.com/api/dc81cbd4c7cd0745  ->  the string following the 'api' is an API key (see bottom of this file)

Examples:
http://api.wunderground.com/api/dc81cbd4c7cd0745/conditions/forecast/q/98126.xml

http://api.wunderground.com/api/dc81cbd4c7cd0745/conditions/astronomy/q/WA/Seattle.json

http://api.wunderground.com/api/dc81cbd4c7cd0745/geolookup/conditions/alerts/q/KSEA.xml

http://api.wunderground.com/api/dc81cbd4c7cd0745/forecast/tide/lang:DL/q/WA/Forks.json
[using lang:DL as a setting for German (should really be DE !)]

-----

General Format:

GET http://api.wunderground.com/api/API_KEY/FEATURES/SETTINGS/q/QUERY.FORMAT

0. Replace API_KEY with yours
1. Replace FEATURES with a path-style list of features, e.g,. /conditions/forecast
2. Replace SETTINGS similarly [but the defaults are good (English)], so you can just omit this
3. Replace QUERY with the location spec, e.g., 98126 or /WA/Seattle
4. Replace FORMAT with either .json or .xml

NOTE: don't forget that darn little 'q' when building the URI !
